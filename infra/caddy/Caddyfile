    # For now, we'll just proxy everything else to the Next.js dev server if running locally,
    # or serve static files if built. 
    # In this dev setup, we might want to proxy to the host machine's Next.js port if running outside docker,
    # or to a 'web' container if we dockerize it.
    # For MVP dev, let's assume we access Next.js directly on localhost:3000 and API on localhost:8000/api
    # But to simulate prod, we can proxy.
    
    # reverse_proxy * host.docker.internal:3000
